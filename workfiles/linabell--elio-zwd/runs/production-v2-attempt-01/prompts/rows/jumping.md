Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `linabell-elio-zwd`, state `jumping`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 5 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure user-selected #6A00FF. Treat the row as 5 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: 粉色毛绒狐狸；保留尖耳、奶油色眼罩和口鼻、蓝眼睛、粉色软帽及固定花朵和蝴蝶结、绿色领结和樱桃、粉黄格纹短袖上衣、粉色点点蕾丝裙及奶油尖端的大尾巴。只用纯色 #6A00FF 背景；不使用蓝色水手服、文字、阴影或独立特效。. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `plush`: Soft plush toy mascot with rounded stitched forms, fuzzy fabric feel, simple sewn details, and readable toy-like proportions. User style notes: 高细节 3D 毛绒玩具渲染，桌宠尺寸清晰可读。.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
